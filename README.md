## üîπ What Can Koppla Do?

Koppla allows you to execute complex **Active Directory queries and updates** effortlessly. Examples:

- **"Find all inactive users who haven't logged in for 90 days."**
- **"Add John Doe to the 'IT Admins' security group."**
- **"List all locked-out user accounts."**
- **"Find all users in the Sales department."**
- **"Which groups does Jane Smith belong to?"**
- **"Show me empty groups."**
- **"Find users in group A but not in group B."**

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Active Directory environment
- Claude Desktop application (for integration with Claude)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Installation**
Koppla requires Python and can be installed using:
```bash
pip install koppla
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Configuration**

#### Using the Configuration Manager (Recommended)

Koppla includes a secure configuration manager that handles encryption of sensitive credentials:

```bash
koppla-config configure
```

This interactive tool will:
1. Prompt for your Active Directory connection details
2. Securely encrypt your password using Fernet symmetric encryption
3. Create or update the Claude Desktop configuration file with Koppla server settings
4. Automatically create a backup of your existing Claude Desktop configuration
5. Test the connection to verify your credentials

You can also:
- Display current configuration: `koppla-config show`
- Test your AD connection: `koppla-config test`

#### Manual Configuration

Koppla uses environment variables for configuration:

| Name             | Description                                        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `AD_SERVER`     | The address of the Active Directory server.      |
| `AD_USER`       | Username for authentication.                     |
| `AD_PASSWORD`   | Password for authentication.                     |
| `BASE_DN`       | Base DN for LDAP queries.                        |
| `AD_WRITE_ENABLED` | Enable or disable write operations (true/false). |

---

To manually configure Koppla with the Claude Desktop app, add the following configuration to the "mcpServers" section of your claude_desktop_config.json:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Koppla-Active-Directory": {
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["-m", "koppla.server"],
        "env": {
            "AD_SERVER": "ldap://<domain-controller-name>:389",
            "AD_USER": "<domain\\username>",
            "AD_PASSWORD": "<password>",
            "BASE_DN": "DC=lazyadmin,DC=nl",
            "AD_WRITE_ENABLED": "false"
        }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîí Security Features

### Password Encryption
- Koppla uses Fernet symmetric encryption (from the cryptography package) to secure your Active Directory password
- The encryption key is stored separately from the configuration in a key file with restricted permissions
- When using the configuration manager, passwords are never stored in plain text
- Encrypted passwords appear as `ENCRYPTED:xxxx...` in the configuration file

### Backup System
- Before any configuration changes, Koppla automatically creates timestamped backups of your Claude Desktop configuration
- Backups are stored alongside your configuration with format: `claude_desktop_config.json.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

### Write Protection
- By default, all write operations (adding/removing users from groups, updating user attributes) are disabled
- To enable write operations, set `AD_WRITE_ENABLED` to "true"
- Critical accounts and groups have additional protection regardless of write settings

#### Supported Write Operations
Koppla supports the following write operations when `AD_WRITE_ENABLED` is set to "true":

1. **Update User Attributes**
   - Modify standard user attributes like description, title, department, etc.
   - Protected fields (passwords, security identifiers, account control) cannot be modified
   - Protected accounts (administrators, service accounts, etc.) cannot be modified

2. **Add User to Group**
   - Add standard users to security or distribution groups
   - Cannot add users to protected administrative groups
   - Protected accounts cannot be added to any groups

3. **Remove User from Group**
   - Remove users from most security or distribution groups
   - Cannot remove users from critical system groups
   - Protected accounts cannot be removed from any groups

All write operations require explicit confirmation before execution.
